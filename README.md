# Core Features

## All-in-One Trip Dashboard

Drivers can effortlessly monitor their schedule with a comprehensive, easy-to-read trip dashboard. Featuring arrival times, estimated time of arrival (ETA) based on current location, location details, and passenger information, drivers have all essential details at their fingertips.

## Intuitive Tap-Through Interface

Navigate your day with ease using our user-friendly interface. A simple tap allows drivers to progress through trips, update trip status, view details, and communicate with passengers. With EzTripr's automatic distance and time tracking, drivers can concentrate on the road while effortlessly collecting vital data for invoicing and tax purposes.

## AI-Powered Schedule Generation

EzTripr integrates OpenAI's Chat Completion API with GPT-3.5-Turbo to extract schedule data from email dispatches. Drivers can copy and paste their dispatches into the app, creating an optimized driving route in just a few clicks. This innovative feature saves time and boosts schedule accuracy.

## Visual Conflict Detection

Our application highlights potential scheduling conflicts with a clear visual representation of trips in the queue. Utilizing Google Maps Distance Matrix API, drivers can effortlessly identify and resolve conflicts, ensuring a smooth and timely driving experience.

# Upcoming Enhancements

## Advanced Trip Queue, Conflict Detection, and Route Optimization

Future releases of EzTripr will further leverage the Google Maps Distance Matrix API to intelligently adjust stop orders, minimizing travel time and maximizing efficiency. By incorporating trip duration data, the app will also ensure sufficient time for each stop before proceeding to the next. This seamless scheduling allows drivers to focus on delivering exceptional passenger experiences.

## Next-Generation AI Integration

As AI technology advances, EzTripr will expand its integration to provide even more convenience for drivers. Features such as automated text messages to inform passengers of delays and AI-assisted schedule adjustments will ease the burden on drivers. Additional applications, like drafting morning emails for passengers, will further streamline communication and enhance the overall trip management experience.
